**# PowerPuffBros_Datahack**:- <br><br>
**(I)DataHack_PreProcessing.ipynb** contains all the steps carried out during pre-processing of data. <br>
  (i) First we have check where dataset contains null values or not <br>
  (ii) Then it drops the rows which contains negative values <br>
  (iii) Then it drops the unnecessary values like ALL IN ON SAVORY , CCard Conveience , Staff Discount , cake cutting charge etc <br>
  (iv) Then it perform Label Encoding for cilent_id and order_id <br>
In preprocessing all the garbage values were removed. <br><br>
**(II)Datahack_FeatureSelection.ipynb**:- contains a cluester for oder_id where order_id contains all the nammes of the item order.<br><br>
**(III)Datahack_Model.ipynb** :- The Apriori algorithm is a data mining algorithm that identifies frequent itemsets in a dataset. By iteratively extending smaller itemsets until no more frequent itemsets can be found. The algorithm is based on the observation that if an itemset is frequent, then all of its subsets must also be frequent. and based on that if user gives a nput i will predict the outpu labeb<br><br>
